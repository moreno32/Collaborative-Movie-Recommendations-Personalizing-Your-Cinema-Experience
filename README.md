# Collaborative Movie Recommendations: Personalizing Your Cinema Experience

## 🔄 Overview:
This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering techniques. The system will make personalized suggestions to users based on their past viewing behavior and preferences. The project will be implemented using Python and the Pandas library. In addition to that, data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn will be utilized to better understand the data and the results of the recommendation system.

## 🎊 Motivation:
Movie recommendations have become an integral part of the online movie-watching experience. From online streaming platforms to movie databases, users are bombarded with suggestions on what to watch next. However, traditional recommendation methods such as content-based filtering can be limiting and might not capture the complexity of a user's tastes and preferences. Collaborative filtering provides a way to address these limitations by incorporating the preferences of multiple users to make recommendations.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Acquiring and preprocessing movie dataset
2)	Understanding and implementing collaborative filtering techniques
3)	Evaluating the effectiveness of the recommendation system
4)	Exploring the advantages and disadvantages of collaborative filtering

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use the Object Detection API, RetinaNet, matplotlib, os, random, zipfile, io, scipy, numpy, glob, imageio, six, PIL, Ipython, and tensorflow.

## 📚 Data Source:
The movie dataset used in this project is from an external source, available as a .zip file.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Acquiring the movie dataset
2)	Preprocessing the data
3)	Implementing collaborative filtering techniques
4)	Evaluating the effectiveness of the recommendation system
5)	Exploring the advantages and disadvantages of collaborative filtering
